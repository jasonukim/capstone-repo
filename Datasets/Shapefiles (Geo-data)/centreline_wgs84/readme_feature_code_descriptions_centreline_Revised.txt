CENTRELINEINTRODUCTION

City of Toronto Centreline data comprises City of Toronto Centreline (TCL) medium scale digital mapping data. This includes the street fabric, rivers, highways, shorelines, trails, and utility corridors, all having names attached. The street layer also includes the address ranges of every street segment on both sides of the centreline.


DATA LIMITATIONS

TCL geography is represented at 2.5 meter or 8 foot positional accuracy. Large-scale representation of TCL data is not suitable for application projects required for utility and parcel mapping. The decisions drawn from this data must be acceptable as per 1:5,000 scale precision. It also should be noted that TCL database consists of mapping data within the jurisdiction of The City of Toronto. Mapping information from surrounding regions of Peel, Durham and York are not included in this database.


LINEAR FEATURE DEFINITION

Highway is designated for fast, long distance travel with restricted access to sustain high speeds. 

Highway Transfer Ramp provides for transfer between road and highway and also between highway and highway.
